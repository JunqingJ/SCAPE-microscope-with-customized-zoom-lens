# SCAPE-microscope-with-customized-zoom-lens
Detailed guideline containing both hardware and software to reproduce the SCAPE microscope with home-built zoom lens. Compare with other variations of OPM systems, SCAPE utilizes a galvo mirror for 3D imaging, making the acquisition much faster and drifting-free. Combining it with a home-built zoom lens, the new systems further extends the imaging capabilities to "any immersion medium" which no longer been constrained by the primary objective lens chosen. Such feature opens up much wider potential applications of SCAPE microscope and making the imaging of tissue-
cleared samples possible. 


The overall diagram of the microscope is shown below:

This project intends to offer those very beginner who barely had any optics background a not-so-intimidating starting point. Contents in this repository are mostly practical/hands-on oriented and keywords of theoretical concepts are provided.
