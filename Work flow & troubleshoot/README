The workflow of this microscope is absolutely not optimized as it is mainly based on commercial software from individual hardware supplier
The sole reason why MicroManager was not used for integrated control is because it lacks ability to send out fast analogue signal required by galvo mirror
MicroManager plugin for analogue signal exists but was designed for OpenSIM and can be tricky to adapt into this system
It is highly suggested to explore the option of integrated control through PycroManager (which can also be benefited from using napari)
Alternatively, pure home written integrated control code (and GUI) can be considered. see reference at Alfred's SOLS microscope (https://github.com/amsikking/SOLS_microscope)
