SCAPE microscope:
It's a variation of single-objective-light-sheet microscope originated from OPM (oblique plane microscope)
It uses one single objective for both illumination and image collection which makes mounting much easier compared to traditional light sheet microscope
This setup is esspecially useful in large scale tissue imaging or live imaging
One of the major limitation of SCAPE setup is that it can only image samples in one single immersion medium. It significantly limits applications for tissue-cleared samples which is becoming more and more popular
Combining the SCAPE microscope with the customized zoom lens desgiend by Alfred Millett-Sikking in his Any Immersion Remote Refocuse Microscopy (https://github.com/amsikking/any_immersion_remote_refocus_microscopy), this microscope should be capable of operating in 
any commonly used immersion medium
For beginners of optics and microscopy, following concepts/designs would be essential for understanding this microscope: remote-refocusing microscope, OPM, SCAPE 2.0, 4f alignment/4f operator (and its difference between 'infinity space'). Fourier optics would be extremely
valuable to understand but it can be quite intimidating at the beginning 

Customized zoom lens:
The reason why a customized zoom lens has to be used instead of a commercial zoom lens is solely due to the 4f alignment constraint. Alfred's zoom lens has a dynamic effective focal distance ranging from 132.5-150mm while the front/back focal plane is kept static
Details of zoom lens design and modeling can be found in Alfred's repository for those interested.
The alignment procedure of zoom lens in this project is modified and hopefully made it easier to adapt in a exisiting system
